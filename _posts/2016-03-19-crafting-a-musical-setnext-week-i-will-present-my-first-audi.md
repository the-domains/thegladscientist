Crafting a Musical Set  
  
Next week I will present my first audio-only set as The Glad Scientist at The Meraki Gathering. I've spent a lot of time over the past month and a half thinking about what I want to do to curate a unique, thoughtful, and personal presentation.

So I decided to play a morning set, a "wake up set" of sorts, to summon the hungover and brainfried into a realm of ambient clouds that sprout soothing colors of all kinds...of course with a cheektongued poking at the cerebrals to promote comfortability in uncomfortability (one of my specialties).

It's been an interesting process, honestly. My musical creations are varied (very), and sewing them together felt like a bastardization of their original tomes, times, and places. So I decided to use the quilt of the outer-edged creations that felt to land on the same musical plane as my own. Although understandably, they are crisper, more professionally produced, and more...normal, they represent some slice of source similar to what oozes from my own contributions. 

Right now my set sits at around 4 hours, and waivers between the ghostly and gleeful, just how I intended it. I'm pretty happy with what I have so far, although I still have to arrange my own songs amongst the rest as the thread to piece together this tapestry of vibrations. I am being honest in saying that this will not be the most "performative" of sets, as I will mostly be mixing and DJing the different materials together vs. recreating them all live. But hey, it's my first try, I'm a beginner.
